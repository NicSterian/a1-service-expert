# Assets guide

- logo.svg: Replace with your branded artwork (ideally an SVG or high-resolution PNG). Update the file in-place to keep imports working.
- images/: Contains hero/background artwork used across the site. Swap any SVG/JPG with your photography while keeping filenames:
  * home-hero.svg (home hero), services-background.svg, eviews-background.svg, services-feature.jpg, ircon-hero.svg, ircon-highlight.svg, diagnostics-hero.svg.
- Video clips: place MP4/WebM files under pps/booking-web/public/media/. The home page looks for media/a1-video.mp4.

All assets here are bundled by Vite. Keep filenames lower-case and without spaces.
